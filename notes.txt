- backend equations
- frontend tiling & rendering


===================
OPERATIONS
- Start with addition, subtraction
- Add multiplication, division
- Add floats
- Add exponential function, log, ...
- Vectors, (matrices)


===================
TODO
- Fix: overlapping equations!
- generate divisors by generating multiplicators
- generate equations such that both lhs and rhs are generated, instead of just generating lhs and computing rhs as its evaluation




====================
IDEAS
- Make it infinite with increasing difficulity



===================
LIMITATIONS
